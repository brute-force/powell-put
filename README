This is a reactive historical stock return web app that returns the current value since an FOMC meeting. It charts the pricing data using [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts) and retrieves company/stock data using a [Community API for Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2).
  
The stack is React 18 on the frontend, Express on the backend, and MongoDB as the data store.
